# Private/Internal Reasoning Record

## What visibility is the repository set to?

The repository is set to: **Internal**

## What decision led to this?

1. **Infrastructure As Code:**
    - The repository contains infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts that configure critical components of our internal
      systems. Keeping these scripts private/internal helps safeguard sensitive configurations and prevents unauthorised
      access.

2. **Sensitive Data:**
    - The repository contains sensitive data, such as intellectual property/proprietary information. By keeping it
      private/internal, we reduce the risk of unauthorised access and maintain control over who can view or modify the
      code.

3. **Awaiting Security Risk Adviser Guidance:**
    - Pending guidance from our security risk advisers, it's prudent to keep the repository private/internal to minimise
      exposure to potential vulnerabilities or security risks.

4. **Non-Public Code:**
    - The code in this repository is not intended for public release. It may contain training materials,
      proof-of-concept (PoC) code, or other proprietary information that is not suitable for public distribution.
